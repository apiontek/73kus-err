# 73k.us custom rainbow error pages (40x/50x)

Based off [frontend-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/WeAreAthlon/frontend-webpack-boilerplate) with TailwindCSS added.

Builds html & css that can be used as custom error pages with, e.g., nginx.

## NOTE

After production build, optionally remove the app.js script tags from the built files, just to optimize things further.
